# Hey there 👋

I'm **Avishekh**, I'm a GenAI Engineer at [liftoff](https://liftoff.io/), where I work on building AI applications for the adtech space. I’ve been working with AI for 6+ years, taking ideas from scratch to production, and I enjoy the challenge of making systems reliable and practical.

I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects — feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat.

**A bit about me:**

- 🧠 I enjoy the research side of AI, from the math behind models to building agentic workflows that actually work in production.
- 📚 I’m a tech bookaholic - I read tech books for fun (yes, it’s a bit unusual).
- 🌍 Based in Kathmandu, Nepal, I care about growing the local tech community while working on global problems.
- ⚽ I’m a big FC Barcelona fan
